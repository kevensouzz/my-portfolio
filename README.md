# Hello World (:
## This is my developer portfolio!

Since February of 2022 when i watched the first class of Applications Development where my teacher Augusto CÃ©sar
introduced us to HTML and CSS i'm passionate about this, passionate about understanding how things work...
about learn new things, as languages, technologies, libraries, frameworks, etc.
On the same day, when i arrived home, i researched for videos about HTML and CSS,
as I didn't have a computer yet, used an app called Acode, at the time it wasn't so good, but it did the trick.

Currently i use technologies like React to Front-End and to Back-End i use Node together Express to API's Buildment.
